The purpose of this repository project is to simulate a world of simple creatures that are cognitively more complex than the original game of life, but are at risk of becoming infected by diseases that alter cognition. We look to alter the *mind* of these creatures to see how the world changes when certain mechanisms are altered; how interactions change, disease spreads, indaviduals choices and movements are altered, new patterns emerge, existing structures change.
